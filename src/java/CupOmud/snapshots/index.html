<h1 align=center>The Cup-O MUD Client in Action</h1>

<p>For those who don't yet have the luxury of a Java-capable system to
try some of this stuff out on, or for those who just want a peek before
proceeding, here are some screen snapshots of what the Cup-O MUD client
looks like, and in particular what it looks like in combination with
some of the other nifty features of the DU-BioWeb MOO web interface.</p>

<p>Except where noted, all of these shots were taken of Netscape 2.01
under Windows 95, with the Live3D VRML plug-in, while connected to
<a href="http://moo.du.org:8888/">Diversity University MOO</a>
(moo.du.org 8888).</p>
