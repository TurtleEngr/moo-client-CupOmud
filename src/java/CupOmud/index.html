<hr>

<h2 align=center>Welcome to the home of Cup-O MUD!</h2>

<p align=center><b>Author</b>: <a href="http://www.crl.com/~riche/">Alex Stewart
(Richelieu)</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:riche@crl.com">riche@crl.com</a>&gt;</p>

<p>This is just a simple page (well, ok, so it's not so simple anymore) I've
whipped up to organize information related to the Cup-O MUD client and its
development.  This page will probably be evolving for a while, so be sure to
check back here every so often to see what's up in the world of Cup-O MUD!</p>

<hr width=80%><h2 align=center>What is it?</h2>

<p>The Cup-O MUD client is a fully functional client for
<a href="CupOmud_docs.html#muve">Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs, aka
MUDs, MU*s, MOOs, etc)</a>, written in the Java programming language.
The Cup-O MUD applet allows embedding an active, real-time link to a
MUVE system right into a web page or web system, which is immediately
available to any user running a Java-capable WWW browser.  Local-install
and standalone versions of the Cup-O MUD client are also in the works.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the <a href="CupOmud_docs.html#what">What
is Cup-O MUD</a> section of <a href="CupOmud_docs.html">the Cup-O MUD
documentation</a>.</p>

<hr width=80%><h2 align=center>Status of the Cup-O MUD project</h2>

<div align=center>
<table border><tr>

<p><b>This is the 1.3 release of Cup-O MUD</b>.  This is primarily a bug-fix release and changes almost nothing about the way the applet actually functions.  I am currently working on the 2.0 release, which will be a significant overhaul, including quite a few new features.  It's a bit too early to predict when this release will actually be out, however.</p>

<p>The other big change with release 1.3 is that Cup-O MUD now comes with a debugging version.  This will help me (and anyone else who wants to) track down problems which people encounter when trying to run Cup-O MUD.  Hopefully, with a little help from a few people out there in browserland, this means by the 2.0 release (or perhaps earlier) most of the problems with mac Netscape and Internet Explorer people have been reporting will be much better.</p>

<hr width=80%><h2 align=center><b><a name="download">Downloading</a></b></h2>

<h3>Who needs to download and install it?</h3>

<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Unlike most peices of software, the Cup-O MUD
client is <em>not</em> downloaded and installed on the user's machine.
Instead, the Cup-O MUD java applet needs to be installed <em>on the
server</em> which serves the web resources users will use to connect to
the MUVE in question.  This means that the Cup-O MUD client must be
installed by the administrators of a particular MUVE system in order for
the users of that system to be able to take advantage of it.</p>

<p><b>Please Also Note:</b> Due to security restrictions inherent in the
Java implementations on all current Java-capable web browsers I am aware
of, Java applets (and thus the Cup-O MUD applet) are only allowed to
open network connections to the same host they were downloaded from.
Since the Cup-O MUD applet needs to open a network connection to the
MUVE in question, this means that in order to function <strong>the
applet must be installed on a HTTP/FTP/etc. server running on the same
physical host as the MUVE it is to connect to</strong>.</p>

<h3>About Java source code</h3>

<p>As of version 1.0, source code for the Cup-O MUD client is also
available.  It is important to stress, however, that Java is designed to
be a platform-independent executable format.  What this means is you do
<em>not</em> need to recompile the Java source code for an applet for each type
of system you want to use it on.  The compiled version of Cup-O MUD
should automatically work under all platforms (unix, Win95, macintosh,
Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc) with no modification.</p>

<h3>How to get it</h3>

<p>There are now two zip archives available for those who want to
install the Cup-O MUD client on their web site:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="CupOmud_1.3_exec.zip">CupOmud_1.3_exec.zip</a> contains the
executable Java class files needed to install Cup-O MUD on a web site,
along with a copy of <a href="CupOmud_docs.html">the Cup-O MUD
documentation</a> and an example HTML file showing a simple
implementation.</li>
 <li><a href="CupOmud_1.3_src.zip">CupOmud_1.3_src.zip</a> contains the source
code for the current Cup-O MUD release, along with some basic
instructions on how to compile and use it.  The source code is not
needed unless you wish to make changes to the Java code of the client
itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> These ZIP files contain subdirectories and <em>must</em> be unzipped with their directory structure intact to work properly.  Specifically, when installing Cup-O MUD on a web site, <code>Applet.class</code> <b>MUST</b> be located in a <code>mudclient</code> directory under the directory which contains <code>CupOmud.class</code>.  You have been warned.</p>

<p>These files are being distributed under the terms of the <a
href="COPYING">GNU Public License</a>.</p>

<hr width=80%><h2 align=center><b>Caveats</b></h2>

<p>Being in good part on the cutting edge of Java development, the Cup-O
MUD client has uncovered its share of bugs in various (still evolving)
systems.  Some of them are actually bugs in Cup-O MUD itself, which I
attempt to correct fairly quickly whenever I find out about them, but
some also turn out to be bugs in web browsers or the underlying Java
implementation, which I have little control over.  Following is a list
of those which have come to my attention thus far:</p>

<h3>Mac Netscape</h3>

<p>Well, what with the release of Mac Netscape 3.0, the Java
implementation seems to be a little better than it used to be, though
it still has some problems.  The good news is that Cup-O MUD does seem
to work... most of the time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have access to a mac myself, and several of
the people who have reported problems to me only seem to be able to
reproduce them intermittently.  However, here's a list of the currently
known problems running Cup-O MUD under Mac Netscape:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The applet will come up and display properly, but will report
    "Connection Failed!".  Netscape's Java Console will report a
    "java.net.SocketException: unknown error".  This is one of the same
    problems which people experienced with Netscape 2.0.. I thought this had
    been fixed with 3.0, but at least one person has reported they still
    encounter it.</li>
 <li>The applet will come up and display properly, will connect to the
    MUVE, and will allow sending commands to the MUVE and respond to MUVE
    output such as display-URL requests, but no output shows up in the
    output window.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these symptoms are apparently due to flawed Java implementations in
various versions of Mac Netscape.  Anyone having problems with this is
encouraged to
<a href="http://www1.netscape.com/cgi-bin/auto_bug.cgi">complain to
netscape</a> about it.</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>I have had varying reports of problems with Internet Explorer (and most of these haven't been much more helpful than "it doesn't work").  I have tried it a couple of times and not had any problems with it myself, which leaves me in much the same situation as with mac Netscape above.. unless someone out there who is having problems can help me out, there's not a lot I can do to track down the problems...</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>The following problems have been reported to me.  I don't have the
resources to verify most of them.  If anyone can provide more info or
(even better) some info on how to get around these problems,
<em>please</em> <a href="mailto:riche@crl.com">let me know</a>.  The
platforms listed for each of the problems are the OS and
application/java-implementation under which the problem was experienced,
as reported to me.  This doesn't necessarily mean these are the only
platforms which have the given problem, and if people know of other
platforms which experience the same behavior as described, please let me
know and I'll add them to the list.</p>

<ul>
<!-- (I'm don't know whether these apply anymore with Netscape 3.0 and
     Cup-O MUD 1.1, so they've been taken off the list unless I hear that
     people are still having problems with them)

 <li><b>[Win95/Netscape]</b> If text from the MUVE arrives while the Cup-O
MUD applet's web page isn't onscreen, the new text doesn't get processed
(even after going back to the applet's page) until the user sends some
input to the MUVE.</li>
 <li><b>[Win95/Netscape]</b> (unconfirmed) Output occasionally stops for a
long time and then resumes for no apparent reason.</li>
 <li><b>[Win95/AppletViewer]</b> When starting up, Sun's AppletViewer prints a
stack trace for a java.io.FileNotFoundException, but the Applet
functions normally anyway (just ignore the error).</li>

-->

 <li><b>[Linux/Netscape]</b> When non-english keyboard mapping facilities are
in use, Java applets appear to respond differently to the keyboard
mappings than the Netscape application does, causing keys to be mapped
to non-english codes for Cup-O MUD input when they aren't for normal
Netscape input (at least I think this is the problem that was reported
to me).</li>
</ul>

<p>Cup-O MUD has been designed, developed, and tested using Netscape
Navigator and the Sun Java Development Kit.</p>
<p>While other Java-capable browsers should function adequately with the
Cup-O MUD applet, Netscape Navigator 3.0 is the recommended web
browser for use with Cup-O MUD.</p>
